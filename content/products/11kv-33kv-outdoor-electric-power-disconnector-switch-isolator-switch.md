summary: >-
  33KV-400A series outdoor high voltage Isolating Switch is the high voltage
  switch

  equipment of composite structure, in the suitable for outdoor 24kv line
  internet with

  voltage and no load, to make separate and fabricate. With CS8 type manpower
  operate

  machinery, to avoid earth line with power and composite flash-locks etc wrong

  operate. The operator no need put another earth line. Pollution-proof type
  isolate

  switch of customer in filthy conduction area. It can solve the pollution of
  shed when it

  is work.

### Environment of use

The altitude above sea level: 2000m
The ambient air temperatures:-40~40°C
Wind speed does not exceed 35m/s
The earthquake intensity does not exceed 8 degrees.
The working situation should be without frequent violent vibration.
The installation site of ordinary type isolator should be kept away form gas, smoke
chemical deposition, sale-spray fog, dust and other explosive and corrosive maters
that affect seriously insulation and conduction capability of the isolator.
Pollution-proof type isolator is applies to sever filthy conduction area, however,
it shouldn’t be any explosive matters and matters causing fire.

### Structure feature

The Isolating Switch consists of three single pole switch, each single pole switch have
same structure, frame, operating insulating, static contactor, blade, etc, for with earth
switch, It can matched with CS operating mechanism, for no earth switch, it can
matched with CS8-5 operating mechanism accordingly.
When without circuit breaker or circuit breaker was fault, switch can opening
and closing under the condition:
A.Voltage transformer which for metering,
B.Charging current which on busbar facility,
C.Power transformer no load current (power transformer capacity should less than
750kVA).
