## Product Description
### 11KV 200KVA Capacity Electrical Oil Immersed Distribution Transformer
Since every country's voltage is different, our company can design and manufacture according to customer's requirements.The oil-immersed transformer is one of the important equipment in the supply and distribution system of industrial and mining enterprises and civil buildings. It will reduce the voltage of network voltage to the bus voltage that the user USES.Such products applied to ac 50 Hz (60), maximum rated capacity of 2500 kva three-phase (single phase maximum rated capacity of 833 kva, single-phase transformer is generally not recommended), can be used in indoor (outside), when capacity of 315 kva and below can be installed on the pole, environment temperature is not higher than 40 ℃, no less than 25 ℃, the highest daily average temperature 30 ℃, the highest annual average temperature is 20 ℃, relative humidity less than 90% (environment temperature 25 ℃), the altitude does not exceed 1000 m.If the above conditions are not in conformity with the above conditions, the relevant provisions of gb650-86 shall be adjusted accordingly.
